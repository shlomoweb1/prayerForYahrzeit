# Validation Tools

Run these after every SEO or GEO implementation. Never assume output is correct
without checking.

## Performance Quick Checks

Core Web Vitals affect ranking. After SEO work, also check:

- [ ] Hero / LCP image is **not** lazy-loaded and uses a modern format
      (`next/image` in Next.js; explicit `width`/`height` elsewhere)
- [ ] Images below the fold are lazy-loaded (`loading="lazy"`)
- [ ] No render-blocking third-party scripts in `<head>` - use `defer`, `async`,
      or `next/script` with an appropriate strategy
- [ ] Run [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) - flag LCP > 2.5s,
      CLS > 0.1, INP > 200ms

## Common Failures

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| OG image missing | Relative URL without `metadataBase` (Next.js) or missing absolute URL |
| JSON-LD errors | Missing required fields, wrong `@type`, relative `url` or `image` |
| Sitemap 404 | File not in `public/` (Vite) or missing `app/sitemap.ts` (Next.js) |
| Meta tags missing in source | CSR-only SPA - tags set only after JavaScript runs |
| Duplicate titles | Missing per-route metadata on dynamic routes |
